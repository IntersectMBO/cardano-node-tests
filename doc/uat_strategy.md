# User Acceptance Test Strategy

User Acceptance Testing takes place after all IOG testing is done and everything is green/pass - unit, component,
integration, feature, sync, system, and regression testing + Benchmarks.

You can find the results for the latest node tag [here](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests/test_results/tag_tests.html).

While our test suites are robust and cover most of the use cases and test types, as Cardano grows and
more dApps and apps start running on it, the community help on discovering and testing edge cases will become
more important than ever.

At the end of the day, what matters the most is to have the confirmation from our users that we
developed the right functionality in the right way.

TBD: for each new tag, define a plan to involve the community in defining the UAT.
