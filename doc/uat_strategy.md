# User acceptance test strategy

User acceptance testing (UAT) takes place after all IOG testing is done and all the tests have passed. This includes unit, component, integration, feature, sync, system, regression testing, and benchmarking.

You can find testing results for the latest node tag [here](https://tests.cardano.intersectmbo.org/test_results/tag_tests.html).

IOG test suites are robust and cover most of the use cases and test types. However, as Cardano grows and more DApps and other decentralized solutions start running on it, the community help in discovering and testing edge cases will become more important than ever.

Finally, what matters most is to have confirmation from our users that we
developed the right functionality in the right way.

TBD: for each new tag, define a plan to involve the community in defining the UAT.
