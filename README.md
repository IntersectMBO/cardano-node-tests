# README for cardano-node-tests

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black)

System and end-to-end (E2E) tests for cardano-node.

Check this [documentation](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests) for more details.

## Installation

Create a Python virtual environment (requires Python v3.8 or newer) and install this package together with development requirements:

```sh
./setup_venv.sh
```

## Usage

Preparing the environment:

```sh
# cd to cardano-node repo
cd <your path to cardano-node repo>
# update and checkout the desired commit/tag
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout tags/<tag>
# launch devops shell
nix-shell -A devops

# cd to tests repo
cd <your path to cardano-node-test repo>
# activate virtual env
. .env/bin/activate
# add virtual env to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$(echo $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3*/site-packages)":$PYTHONPATH
# set env variables
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=<your path to cardano-node repo>/state-cluster0/bft1.socket
```

Check that the environment is correctly set up by running:

```text
$ ./check_env.sh
'cardano-node' available: ✔
'cardano-cli' available: ✔
'python' available: ✔
'pytest' available: ✔
'nix-shell' available: ✔
'jq' available: ✔
'supervisord' available: ✔
'supervisorctl' available: ✔
'bech32' available: ✔
inside nix shell: ✔
in repo root: ✔
DEV cluster: ✔
python works: ✔
in python venv: ✔
venv in PYTHONPATH: ✔
cardano-node-tests installed: ✔
pytest works: ✔
same version of node and cli: ✔
socket path set: ✔
socket path correct: ✔
socket path exists: ✔
cluster era: babbage
transaction era: babbage
using dbsync (optional): ✔
dbsync available: ✔
P2P network (optional): -
```

Running tests on a local cluster (local cluster instances will be started automatically during test run setup):

```sh
make tests
```

Running tests on one of the testnets:

```sh
# set env variables
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=<your path to cardano-node repo>/state-cluster0/relay1.socket
# run tests
BOOTSTRAP_DIR=<your path to bootstrap dir> make testnets
```

Running individual tests:

```sh
pytest -k "test_name1 or test_name2" cardano_node_tests
```

Running linter:

```sh
# activate virtual env
. .env/bin/activate
# run linter
make lint
```

## Variables for `make tests` and `make testnets`

* `SCHEDULING_LOG` – specifies the path to the file where log messages for tests and cluster instance scheduler are stored
* `PYTEST_ARGS` – specifies additional arguments for pytest
* `MARKEXPR` – specifies marker expression for pytest
* `TEST_THREADS` – specifies the number of pytest workers
* `CLUSTERS_COUNT` – number of cluster instances that will be started
* `CLUSTER_ERA` – cluster era for Cardano node – used for selecting the correct cluster start script
* `TX_ERA` – era for transactions – can be used for creating Shelley-era (Allegra-era, ...) transactions
* `NOPOOLS` – when running tests on testnet, a cluster with no staking pools will be created
* `BOOTSTRAP_DIR` – path to a bootstrap dir for the given testnet (genesis files, config files, faucet data)
* `SCRIPTS_DIRNAME` – path to a dir with local cluster start/stop scripts and configuration files

For example:

```sh
SCHEDULING_LOG=testrun_20221005_1.log TEST_THREADS=3 CLUSTER_ERA=babbage TX_ERA=alonzo SCRIPTS_DIRNAME=cardano_node_tests/cluster_scripts/babbage/ PYTEST_ARGS="-k 'test_stake_pool_low_cost or test_reward_amount'" MARKEXPR="not long" make tests
```


## Tests development

When running tests, the testing framework starts and stops cluster instances as needed. That is not ideal for test development, as starting a cluster instance takes several epochs (to get from Byron to Babbage). To keep the Cardano cluster running in between test runs, one needs to start it in 'development mode':

```sh
# activate virtual env
. .env/bin/activate
# prepare cluster scripts
prepare-cluster-scripts -d <destination dir>/babbage -s cardano_node_tests/cluster_scripts/babbage/
# set env variables
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=<your path to cardano-node repo>/state-cluster0/bft1.socket DEV_CLUSTER_RUNNING=1
# start the cluster instance in development mode
<destination dir>/babbage/start-cluster-hfc
```

After the cluster starts, keys and configuration files are available in the `<your path to cardano-node repo>/state-cluster0` directory. The pool-related files and keys are located in the `nodes` subdirectory, genesis keys in the `shelley` and `byron` subdirectories, and payment address with initial funds and related keys in the `byron` subdirectory. The local faucet address and related key files are stored in the `addrs_data` subdirectory.

To restart the cluster (eg, after upgrading `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` binaries), run:

```sh
./scripts/restart_dev_cluster.sh
```


## Test coverage of Cardano CLI commands

To get test coverage of Cardano CLI commands, run tests as usual (`make tests`) and generate the coverage report JSON file with:

```sh
cardano-cli-coverage -i .cli_coverage/cli_coverage_*.json -o .cli_coverage/coverage_report.json
```


## Building documentation

Install Sphinx into your virtual environment:

```sh
make install_doc
```

Build and deploy documentation:

```sh
./deploy_doc.sh
```


## Contributing

Install this package and its dependencies as described above.

Run `pre-commit install` to set up the Git hook scripts that will check your changes before every commit. Alternatively, run `make lint` manually before pushing your changes.

Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), with the exception that formatting is handled automatically by [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) (through the `pre-commit` command).
