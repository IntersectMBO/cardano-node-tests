Nightly system tests pipelines
==============================

These Cardano node system tests are run on a nightly basis. The tests are run on multiple instances of a local cluster.
The tests are run on the `master` branch of the `cardano-node` repository.

Several pipelines run the nightly system tests. In each pipeline, different sets of tests are run.


Test statuses
-------------

* **failed** - tests that failed assertion or that were aborted because of unhandled exception
* **broken** - tests that are affected by a real known issue; these are marked as `xfailed` (expected failure) until the issue is fixed
* **skipped** - tests that are not meant to run in the given pipeline
