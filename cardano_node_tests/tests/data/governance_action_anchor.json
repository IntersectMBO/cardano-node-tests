It enables treasury withdrawals, the ability to record a new constitution, updates to the constitutional committee, and votes of no confidence. These are in addition to the 3 existing governance actions that were enabled for Protocol Version 9 by the Chang hard fork (hard forks, parameter updates, and info actions). Following the hard fork, the protocol will support a number of new Plutus primitives that have been defined in CIP-0122, CIP-0123 and CIP-0127. These provide bitwise and logical operations on byte strings, plus RIPEMD-160 cryptographic hashing functionality (for compatibility with BitCoin). Cardano was created to address the limitations of earlier blockchain platforms, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, by offering a more scalable, secure, and sustainable ecosystem. Its development is driven by scientific rigor, peer-reviewed research, and a commitment to decentralization. Cardano's Proof-of-Stake protocol, Ouroboros, ensures energy efficiency and long-term sustainability. The platform aims to provide financial inclusion, enable smart contracts, and support decentralized applications (dApps) while maintaining high security and interoperability.
