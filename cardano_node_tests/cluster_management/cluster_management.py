"""Module for exposing useful components of cluster management.

The cluster management system is designed to manage a pool of Cardano cluster instances for running
tests in parallel using `pytest-xdist`. It coordinates access to these shared cluster instances
by multiple test workers.

Key concepts:
- **Pool of Instances**: Multiple cluster instances can be running concurrently. Each test worker
  requests a cluster instance to run a test on.
- **Coordination via File System**: Workers communicate and coordinate through a system of status
  files created on a shared file system. These files act as locks and signals to indicate the
  state of cluster instances (e.g., which test is running, if a respin is needed, which
  resources are locked). The `status_files` module manages the creation and lookup of these
  files.
- **Resource Management**: Tests can declare what resources they need. A resource can be, for
  example, a specific feature of a cluster that cannot be used by multiple tests at the same
  time. The `ClusterManager` handles locking of these resources so that only one test can use
  them at a time.
- **Cluster Respin**: Some tests can modify the state of a cluster in a way that it cannot be
  used by subsequent tests. These tests can request a "respin" of the cluster instance, which
  re-initializes it to a clean state.
- **`ClusterManager`**: This is the main class that test fixtures interact with. Its `get()`
  method is used to acquire a suitable cluster instance for a test, taking into account available
  instances, resource requirements, and scheduling priority.

This system allows for efficient parallel execution of tests that require a running Cardano
cluster, by reusing cluster instances and managing contention for shared resources.
