\* RAM usage for `1.35.7-rc1` is between 3 to 4GB higher than for `1.35.5`.

.. warning::
    There is a clearly visible pattern of significantly higher `cardano-node` RAM usage since release `1.35.5`.

    RAM usage for `1.35.6` was on average 2GB bigger than for `1.35.5`.
    Now with release `1.35.7` difference grew to values between 3 to 4GB higher than for `1.35.5`.

    Release `1.35.7` (legacy topology) requires more than 20GB of RAM which is much more than officially recommended RAM amount (16GB).

      - We encourage our early adopters to look into the below scenarios as part of the UAT for the current tag:
      - scenarios with different node versions, different P2P settings (only with Legacy/P2P relays, with a mix of relays)
      - tests confirming that stake pools with P2P Single Relay does not have a competitive (dis)advantage
      - tests with stake pools having different node versions and P2P settings (1 relay with 1.35.4 and another one with 1.35.7 + P2P Single Relay)
      - renewal of certificates and restart of the nodes
   * - Audits
